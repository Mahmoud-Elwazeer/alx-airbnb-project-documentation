# **🎯 Objective:**

Learners will **identify and document the key features and functionalities of the Airbnb Clone backend** by understanding the technical and functional requirements necessary for building a scalable, secure, and robust system.

# **📚 Introduction to Project Requirements**

Backend development involves creating the server-side logic, database management, and API integrations that power a web application. In this concept page, we will focus on the backend requirements for the **Airbnb Clone project**, emphasizing the key features that make the app functional, user-friendly, and efficient.

The requirements outlined below are categorized into **Core Functionalities**, **Technical Requirements**, and **Non-Functional Requirements**.

# **🔑 Core Functionalities**

The backend for the Airbnb Clone must enable key features that align with the functionalities of a rental marketplace.

# **1. User Management**

- **User Registration**:
    - Allow users to sign up as **guests** or **hosts**.
    - Use secure authentication methods like **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.
- **User Login and Authentication**:
    - Implement login via email and password.
    - Include **OAuth** options (e.g., Google, Facebook).
- **Profile Management**:
    - Enable users to update their profiles, including profile photos, contact info, and preferences.

# **2. Property Listings Management**

- **Add Listings**:
    - Hosts can create property listings by providing details such as title, description, location, price, amenities, and availability.
- **Edit/Delete Listings**:
    - Hosts can update or remove their property listings.

# **3. Search and Filtering**

- Implement search functionality to allow users to find properties by:
    - Location
    - Price range
    - Number of guests
    - Amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly)
- Include pagination for large datasets.

# **4. Booking Management**

- **Booking Creation**:
    - Guests can book a property for specified dates.
    - Prevent double bookings using date validation.
- **Booking Cancellation**:
    - Allow guests or hosts to cancel bookings based on the cancellation policy.
- **Booking Status**:
    - Track booking statuses such as pending, confirmed, canceled, or completed.

# **5. Payment Integration**

- Implement secure payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle:
    - Upfront payments by guests.
    - Automatic payouts to hosts after a booking is completed.
- Include support for multiple currencies.

# **6. Reviews and Ratings**

- Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties.
- Hosts can respond to reviews.
- Ensure reviews are linked to specific bookings to prevent abuse.

# **7. Notifications System**

- Implement email and in-app notifications for:
    - Booking confirmations
    - Cancellations
    - Payment updates

# **8. Admin Dashboard**

- Create an admin interface for monitoring and managing:
    - Users
    - Listings
    - Bookings
    - Payments

# **🛠️ Technical Requirements**

# **1. Database Management**

- Use a relational database such as **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**.
- Required tables:
    - Users (guests and hosts)
    - Properties
    - Bookings
    - Reviews
    - Payments

# **2. API Development**

- Use **RESTful APIs** to expose backend functionalities to the frontend.
- Include proper HTTP methods and status codes for:
    - GET (retrieve data)
    - POST (create data)
    - PUT/PATCH (update data)
    - DELETE (remove data)
- Use **GraphQL** for complex data fetching scenarios (optional but recommended).

# **3. Authentication and Authorization**

- Use **JWT** for secure user sessions.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate permissions between:
    - Guests
    - Hosts
    - Admins

# **4. File Storage (Scenario based)**

- Store property images and user profile photos in cloud storage solutions such as **AWS S3** or **Cloudinary**. For implementation, we will use file storage

# **5. Third-Party Services**

- Use email services like **SendGrid** or **Mailgun** for email notifications.

# **6. Error Handling and Logging**

- Implement global error handling for APIs.

# **🚀 Non-Functional Requirements**

# **1. Scalability**

- Use a modular architecture to ensure the app scales easily as traffic increases.
- Enable horizontal scaling using load balancers.

# **2. Security**

- Secure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) using encryption.
- Implement firewalls and rate limiting to prevent malicious activities.

# **3. Performance Optimization**

- Use **caching** tools like Redis to improve response times for frequently accessed data (e.g., search results).
- Optimize database queries to reduce server load.

# **4. Testing**

- Implement unit and integration tests using frameworks like **pytest** .
- Include automated API testing to ensure endpoints function as expected.
